# SH1W4 Profile - Cursor AI Rules

## Project Identity
This is a **GitHub Profile README** repository for SH1W4 (Symbiotic Human-AI Workflow Architect).
Focus: Professional branding, visual aesthetics, modular project management.

## Code Style
- Python: PEP 8, type hints preferred
- Markdown: Clean formatting, emoji for visual hierarchy
- JSON: 2-space indentation, no trailing commas

## Workflow Commands
# Update projects list
python generate_readme.py

# Regenerate biostats
python generate_biostats.py

## Design Constraints
- Colors: Only use #00FF41 (green) and #BD93F9 (purple)
- Keep aesthetic: Biocybernetic, minimal, professional
- All images: Optimized (PNG < 500KB, GIF < 200KB)

## Important Rules
1. NEVER edit README.md manually - always regenerate from projects.json
2. Keep commit messages conventional (feat:, fix:, docs:)
3. Test GitHub Actions locally before pushing workflow changes
4. Preserve the modular structure

## When Editing Projects
1. Edit projects.json
2. Run generate_readme.py
3. Verify output
4. Commit all changes together

## IP Protection Rules (ECO-PROT-01)
1. **Public vs Private**: Interfaces and UI are PUBLIC. Scoring logic and proprietary algorithms are PRIVATE.
2. **Document Abstraction**: Describe *what* the system does, not *how* it calculates it (avoid revealing weights or specific LLM hyper-params).
3. **Black-Box Architecture**: In diagrams, represent core logic as a sealed module.
4. **Data Privacy**: Never include real user data or production logs in public repositories.
5. **Specification Privacy**: Keep master thesis and deep technical blueprints in private repositories/folders.

## Context
User is JX (SH1W4), AI Systems Architect.
Goal: Impress recruiters from US/EU tech companies.
Target: Remote positions $80k-140k USD.
